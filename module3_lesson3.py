# Intro to ORM's

"""
    An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool that allows developers to interact with database using object-oriented programming (OOP)
    concepts. It abstracts SQL commands, letting you work with database entities as if they were regular objects in your programming
    language. This simplifies database interaction by aloowing developers to work with data in a way that's familiar to them in a
    language such as Python, without writing raw SQL querires.
    
    Why Use an ORM?
        1. Easf of Use: Instead of writing SQL queries, you manipulate Python objects.
        2. Portability: ORMs allow you to write database-agnostic code, making it easier to switch between database systems
        (MySWL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
        3. Security: ORM libraries usually come with built-in protections against SQL injection attacks.
        4. Productivity: You spend less time writing boilerplate code for database interaction.
        
    Basic Concepts of ORMs
        - Model: Each model in an ORM corresponds to a table in your database. Attributes of the model correspond to columns.
        - Instance: An instance of a model represents a row/record in the table.
        - Query: ORM libraries provide query builders that allow you to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data.

# SQLAlchemy 2.0: Python's Most Popular ORM

"""
    SQLAlchemy is a powerful and flexible ORM that allows you to perform database operations in Python. Version 2.0 brings
    several improvements, including more modern and expressive syntax, and improved type hinting and async support.
    
    
    Virtual Environments - a virtual environment is an isolated workspace for Python projects that allows you to manage tools
    (packages) for a specific project.
